    Using the hash manager allows you to map a RESTful hash (e.g. <code>http://www.sky.com/#!weather/edit</code>) to a javascript function.
</p>
<p>
    You can register a `wild card` hash (e.g. <code>basket/*</code>) to quickly assign a single function to a number of hashes.
</p>
<p>
    If a wild card hash has been registered along side an `exact` hash (e.g. <code>basket/show</code>) then the `exact` match function would be executed.
